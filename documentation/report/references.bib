	abstract = {The development of applications as well as the services for mobile systems faces a varied range of devices with very heterogeneous capabilities whose response times are difficult to predict. The research described in this work aims to respond to this issue by developing a computational model that formalizes the problem and that defines adjusting computing methods. The described proposal combines imprecise computing strategies with cloud computing paradigms in order to provide flexible implementation frameworks for embedded or mobile devices. As a result, the imprecise computation scheduling method on the workload of the embedded system is the solution to move computing to the cloud according to the priority and response time of the tasks to be executed and hereby be able to meet productivity and quality of desired services. A technique to estimate network delays and to schedule more accurately tasks is illustrated in this paper. An application example in which this technique is experimented in running contexts with heterogeneous work loading for checking the validity of the proposed model is described.},

abstract = {We present a survey of the state-of-the-art techniques used in performing data and memory-related optimizations in embedded systems. The optimizations are targeted directly or indirectly at the memory subsystem, and impact one or more out of three important cost metrics: area, performance, and power dissipation of the resulting implementation.We first examine architecture-independent optimizations in the form of code transoformations. We next cover a broad spectrum of optimization techniques that address memory architectures at varying levels of granularity, ranging from register files to on-chip memory, data caches, and dynamic memory (DRAM). We end with memory addressing related issues.},

abstract = {TimeStream is a distributed system designed specifically for low-latency continuous processing of big streaming data on a large cluster of commodity machines. The unique characteristics of this emerging application domain have led to a significantly different design from the popular MapReduce-style batch data processing. In particular, we advocate a powerful new abstraction called resilient substitution that caters to the specific needs in this new computation model to handle failure recovery and dynamic reconfiguration in response to load changes. Several real-world applications running on our prototype have been shown to scale robustly with low latency while at the same time maintaining the simple and concise declarative programming model. TimeStream handles an on-line advertising aggregation pipeline at a rate of 700,000 URLs per second with a 2-second delay, while performing sentiment analysis of Twitter data at a peak rate close to 10,000 tweets per second, with approximately 2-second delay.},

abstract = {Power-efficient design requires reducing power dissipation in all parts of the design and during all stages of the design process subject to constraints on the system performance and quality of service (QoS). Power-aware high-level language compilers, dynamic power management policies, memory management schemes, bus encoding techniques, and hardware design tools are needed to meet these often-conflicting design requirements. This paper reviews techniques and tools for power-efficient embedded system design, considering the hardware platform, the application software, and the system software. Design examples from an Intel StrongARM based system are provided to illustrate the concepts and the techniques. This paper is not intended as a comprehensive review, rather as a starting point for understanding power-aware design methodologies and techniques targeted toward embedded systems.},
